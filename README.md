# Ledsticklib
This is a library designed for the Adafruit Neopixel 8x50 led stick. But other ws2812b led sticks can also be used for this library. 

There are three ways to use Ledsticklib:

1: The Arduino IDE. This is the easiest way but I don't recommend it since the code editor is not very flexible and can be very annoying sometimes. 

2. Visual studio code. This is in my opinion the most recommended way because i think that Visual studio code is the most flexible and user oriented code editor. But since the library uses Arduino functions and port manipulation it is recommended that you dowload the Arduino IDE and the Arduino extension. The link below is a walktrough on how you can dowload and configure the Arduino library on Visual studio code.

3. Other code editors. Because i haven't got any expierence with other code editors i don't have a excact walktrough on how you implement Ledsticklib on other code editors. But be sure to download the Arduino IDE and include the Arduino.h file(makefile is recommended) in your code.
